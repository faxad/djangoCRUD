### What is this repository for? ###

* The intention was to develop a generic framework using Python/Django for the rapid development of CRUD based web applications. The framework simplifies the development process by relying only on Model creation. The generic framework automatically takes care of providing the necessary Views, Templates, Forms and URLs. Additionally, a simple configuration allows the developer to specify which fields to display in Create, Update, Display and Preview operations. Configured search-using Haystack. There is a whole lot of features that can enhance the framework. I would leave that to the open source community to contribute and take it further to the next level.

* Version 0.5
